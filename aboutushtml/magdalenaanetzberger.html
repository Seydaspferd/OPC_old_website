            I became aware of OPC through the website WWOOF, a portal for the 
worldwide placement of ecological farm projects. I had been to Ghana 
once before and had fallen in love with the country and its people, but 
this time I really wanted to volunteer. Since for me one of the keys to 
overcoming our global crisis lies in a sustainable, ecological and above 
all regional way of doing business, I wanted to gain practical experi-
ence with projects that pursue such approaches.
 <br>
 <br>

Therefore, last year I was able to spend four months at OPC. For me it 
was an incredibly enriching time; I learnt a lot in the herb and vegeta-
ble garden as well as the mushroom farm and tried out certain things 
myself. Among other things, I realized that it is not always easy and 
many things do not work right away. This taught me patience. The 
people at OPC are survivors who do not get discouraged so quickly. If 
it does not work this time, it will work the next time. I hope to keep this 
confidence and carry it forward. In addition, my appreciation for food 
has increased. It was wonderful to harvest what was available in the 
garden - a small green bell pepper, some green onions, eggplant, 
delicious water leaves (similar to spinach but much better) and of 
course the fantastic oyster mushrooms - and then prepare it all in the 
small kitchen.

Many conversations at OPC inspired me a lot and I was able to experi-
ence how nice it is when people care for each other. The motto of OPC 
- for more inner peace - was exemplified to me and I was a part of it. I 
felt very accepted and I realized how important this motto is for solv-
ing our current problems; because only those who take good care of 
themselves and are inwardly content and balanced can then also take 
good care of others. A small part of my heart has definitely remained 
on OPC land. I am very much looking forward to returning soon to 
learn many more things, but above all to meet again all the wonderful 
people from whom I was able to learn so much.
