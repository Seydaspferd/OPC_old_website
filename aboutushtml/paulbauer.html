        <h2>Paul Bauer, Mushroom production</h2>
        <br />
        <div class="descriptionparagraph">
          <p>
            I have always wanted to establish a mushroom cultivation system 
            myself. Since I had already grown oyster mushrooms as a hobby, I 
            brought a little experience in mushroom cultivation with me before I 
            came to Ghana. Even though I had done some small tests beforehand, I 
            knew that it would be a challenge for me to grow mushrooms at OPC. I 
            did not know anything about the local weather conditions and pests 
            that could threaten the growth of the mushrooms, and I did not know 
            how many resources were already available on the farm. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Therefore, I exchanged information with the President of OPC, Dr 
            Christian Andres, and learned about mushroom cultivation in tropical 
            countries to gain as much knowledge as possible before I left for 
            Ghana. Arriving at the OPC farm, I met Justice Cudjoe, who already 
            had experience in local mushroom cultivation. I received a lot of help-
            ful advice from him, and was eventually able to grow mushrooms at 
            OPC and make them available for consumption and sale. In addition, I 
            have passed on the knowledge I have gained to permanent staff at 
            OPC so that they can continue production.
            <br>
            <br>
              In the future, I will look for new cultivation techniques that can 
            further improve the production system, and I will continue to stay in 
            contact with OPC to exchange ideas on mushroom cultivation.
