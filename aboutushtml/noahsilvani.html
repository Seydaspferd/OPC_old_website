            On the subject of sustainability, I was particularly interested in per-
            maculture and self-sufficiency; living in connection with nature with -
            out damaging it. I was looking for a way to combine my love of travel 
            with experience in this field and meaningful work that challenges me 
            and where I can live out my creativity. This is how my fate led me to 
            Christian Andres, the President of OPC Switzerland. The OPC project 
            immediately grabbed me and I saw an opportunity to contribute my 
            expertise and professional experience as a carpenter. 
            <br>
            <br>
            My well-intentioned idea to go from a privileged first world country to 
            the so-called „third world“ to offer my help took me to Ghana. Once 
            there, I was able to learn that this division into different worlds dis -
            solved for me. I learnt a lot by living and working together with the 
            local people, and the challenges that my stay in Ghana posed to me 
            taught me a lot about myself.
            <br>
            <br>
            The day in Ghana ends while cooking over the fire in the jungle or on 
            the beach. We are exhausted, but with a satisfied feeling about the 
            work done. This helps me to find my inner peace!
