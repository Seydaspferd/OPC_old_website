            My story begins in the village of Busua at a well shaft, as there are 
many in the village. I try my hand at pulling up water from the well with 
a bucket attached to a rope: Lowering the bucket down the rope, then 
tipping the bucket back and forth to dip it into the water at the right 
moment. Crap. Missed the timing again, the bucket lands sideways on 
the water surface and remains empty. After a few more tries, I finally 
scooped up enough water to rinse the salt crust off the surfboard from 
the previous surf session.

Much of my project work at OPC also revolved around one of the most 
basic, yet precious commodities of all - water. The importance of water 
in sufficient quality and quantity is especially appreciated when it is 
not available. When you first have to start a pump for a shower, fix a 
temporary pipe, fill containers and then carry them up to the shower 
site. When you have to carry drinking water - either by wheelbarrow or 
by car.
<br>

Fortunately, things are different at OPC in Busua today. Thanks to the 
new water system, consisting of pipes, tanks and a membrane water 
filter to produce drinking water, it now looks like this: Shower tap open 
to shower, water tap open to drink. Much better. Since I unfortunately 
left unexpectedly due to Corona before the implementation of the 
project I had planned and designed, I will probably have to return to 
this beautiful spot to try this out for myself. Therefore, there is only 
one way for me: back to Ghana - back to Busua.
