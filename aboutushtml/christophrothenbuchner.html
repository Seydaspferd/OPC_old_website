          <p>
            In spring 2019, I completed my internship at OPC in Busua. I came with 
            the desire to bring people closer to sustainable living and business and 
            to use my background to serve the company‘s goals. As I have been 
            active as an actor for the last ten years and recently warmed up to 
            contemporary dance, dance theatre workshops with educational 
            mission were planned.
            <br>
            <br>
            First, I worked in the field to get to know the dynamic agroforestry 
            system. Then I helped carpenter Thomas to cover the wooden roof. 
            During meals together, I got familiar with the philosophy of the project 
            and learned to communicate a little bit linguistically. From the halfway 
            point on, I led a dance-theatre workshop at the local school, which led 
            to a joint film project.
            <br>
            <br>
            My time at OPC in Busua has shaped and changed me a lot. Before 
            that, I wanted to continue to fight my way in the arts, but today I want 
            to dedicate my resources to a good life for all and the fight against 
            climate change. Therefore, I hope to be able to support OPC with my 
            skills in the future. M‘edase wo ho!
