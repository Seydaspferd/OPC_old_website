        <h2>Joëlle Martz, BSc student 
            sustainable tourism</h2>

        <div class="descriptionparagraph">
          <p>
            In my field of expertise, tourism, the topic of sustainability is a complex 
and sometimes paradoxical challenge. For several years, I have been 
dealing with the topic privately, professionally and academically and 
strive to understand and develop my own approaches to solutions and 
implement them. In 2020, OPC gave me the chance to dive further into 
this passion by conducting my bachelor thesis. Therefore, in Busua, I 
explored the question of how OPC can best communicate the principle 
of sustainability to its national and international visitors. 
<br>
<br>

After working out the disposition in Switzerland, I found out on site 
that adapting the question to local conditions took more time than 
planned. With the professional and emotional support of Israel Ashitey 
(‚Joeman‘), Mohammed Zakari (‚Zak‘) and Theresa Oppong, I neverthe-
less rose to the challenge. The three of them introduced me to the local 
conditions and supported me in various ways, which greatly enriched 
my work and personal experience. Thus, I found myself in the precious 
role of the learner, a state that I want to enable all future visitors of the 
project to be in through my work.
<br>
<br>
I hope that my work can be used to ensure that even short stays at 
OPC are characterized by an exciting exchange with like-minded 
people from different cultures, and thus new skills can be learnt. 
<br>
<br>
It can also enrich OPC with an understanding of the challenges that lie 
ahead, and show approaches to implementing tourism offerings in a 
way that promotes shared learning about sustainability. Whether I will 
be able to witness these steps from afar or on the ground is not yet 
clear. What I do know is that OPC can always count on my support, no 
matter where I am.
